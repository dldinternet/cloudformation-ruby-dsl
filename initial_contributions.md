Several people were instrumental in building this project during its incubation stage. Because the process of open sourcing involved squashing the repository to remove confidential information, some of their contributions have been lost from the history that Github displays.

- [Shawn Smith](https://github.com/shawnsmith): initial implementation
- [Nathaniel Eliot](https://github.com/temujin9): converted from raw library to gem, refactored table code, cleaned and prepared code for open sourcing
- [Jona Fenocchi](http://github.com/jonaf): added support for CloudFormation tags
